# IRIS
General explanatory Data Analysis / 

I know there are tons of repositories available for the Exploratory Data Analysis on the famous Iris Data set.
Here I donâ€™t intend to do all the algorithmic code instead i will use the tools that have already been developed.
This is my version of EDA + Classification model on Iris Dataset since it is one of the most common datasets that I came across in my journey into the data science world.
There are many versions of this dataset but i will be using the one from sklearn.datasets.
